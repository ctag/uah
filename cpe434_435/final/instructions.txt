CPE 435 Final

All ,

You need to write two programs ,Server and client .The server should be start first then :

The server program runs on one machine,reads an array of size 4M elements (could be integers ) randomly ,then divides the array into n sub-arrays (minimum two) and send each sub array to one of the client (clients should running on different machines ).

each client receive the sub-array from the server ,then it must sort the sub array using merge sort.the client should creates a number of threads to speed up the process of sorting (minimum two threads ).then it will send the result back to the server.

 

The server must waits until receive all sorted sub arrays from all clients ,then sort the sub sorted arrays int  a final  sorted array and store the result in a file.

 

You should save each sub array into a file and save the sorted one in another file. 

Undergraduate Student can use pthread or openmp  or MPI.

Graduates students must use openmp,MPI

Students can work in groups (Maximum two ),provided that the works divide evenly.

Time for demonstration the result will be same as the lab scheduled time.please send me email before. 

all students must complete their works before Dec 1,2015.

 

Good luck
